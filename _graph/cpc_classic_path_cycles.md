**Classic paths and cycles** might sound a little too generic, however I want to put the following algorithms in the same group even if they do not have anything in common, simply because it seems more natural. So, the **girth** is the shortest cycle in a graph, the **Eulerian cycle** is a cycle that visits all edges once and **Hamiltonian cycle** is the cycle that visits every node once:
* <a href="/cpc_girth/"> Shortest Simple Cycle (girth) </a>
* <a href="/cpc_eulerian/"> Eulerian Path/Cycle </a>
* <a href="/cpc_hamiltonian/"> Hamiltonian Path/Cycle </a>
