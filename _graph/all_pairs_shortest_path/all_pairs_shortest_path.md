title: All Pairs Shortest Paths

The **Bellman-Ford** and **Dijkstra** algorithms find the single-source shortest-paths. Using the same idea, we can **generalize Bellman-Ford** and obtain all-pairs shortest paths in weighted digraph with no negative cycle. A better alternative is **Floydâ€“Warshall**, another dynamic programming algorithm which I like to call *the DP at its peak*. These two algorithms can be applied to weighted graphs with no-negative edges as well (just as Bellman-Ford). Another alternative to these DP algorithms is **Johnson's algorithm**. This one uses a combination of **Bellman-Ford** and **Dijkstra**. In short, it uses **Bellman-Ford** to make all weights positive and **Dijkstra** to find all-pairs shortest-paths.
